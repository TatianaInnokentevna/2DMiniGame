In the game, a simple logic is implemented: if the user clicks on the screen, we shrink the object, and the longer the user holds the mouse button, the greater the force of the object's jump. As soon as the user releases the mouse button, the object should jump.

The goal of the game is to land on the platforms that are below. If the player misses a platform, a restart button should be shown, and the player character should be removed from the scene.

The player character has an animation for when it is idle and an animation for when it is jumping.
